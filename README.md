# kickass-torrents-cp

A community project revival of the original Kickass Torrents.

This project is fully open source and runs on the [CodeIgniter Framework][ci].

This has been a few weekends worth of work, but still has a long way to go. Since [KATCR.co][katcr] has brought in torrents, there hasn't been a huge reason to continue. But it'd be nice to have this finished one day.
